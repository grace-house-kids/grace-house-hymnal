"""Grace House — a tiny web site for a home church.

The front page (/{key}/) shows a swappable quote and a button for each
section of the site. The hymnal reads plain-text hymns from ./hymns and
serves them as a numbered table of contents (/{key}/hymnal/) plus
per-hymn pages, mobile-first, styled to match the Grace House brand.

The entire site is served under a URL prefix (the "access key"). The
key comes from the HYMNAL_KEY environment variable (GitHub stores it as
a secret and hands it to the build), or from ./access-key.txt on your
own computer. access-key.txt is listed in .gitignore so it never goes
back into the repo. Anyone without the key sees a 404 page. The QR code
page (/{key}/qr) draws the code from the site's own address, so it
always matches the current key.

Front page quotes: ./quote.txt — one is picked at random on every visit.
    If I only love people like me, I must really love me.

    Second quote here.
    — optional attribution line starting with a dash
Separate quotes with a blank line. Lines starting with # are ignored.

Bible verse chip: ./verses.txt — one reference per line (John 3:16),
one picked at random on every visit and shown in the front page's
top-right corner. Lines starting with # are ignored.

Events: ./events.txt — one event per block, blank line between events.
    September 27 2026
    Fall potluck
    Bring a dish to share. We eat at noon.
The first line of a block is the date; everything after it is details
(lines starting "- " become bullets). The events page shows this
month's calendar with a pink circle on every day that has an event,
then every event from today on. Both are worked out in the visitor's
browser, so the page rolls over to a new day and month by itself and
past events drop off without a rebuild. The weekday is figured out
from the date, so you don't need to type it. Dates can be written
"September 27 2026", "Sun Sep 27th, 2026", "9/27/2026" or
"2026-09-27" — always with the year. Put times on the next line.

Sections: see SECTIONS below. A section whose page isn't built yet
shows a "coming soon" page with a way back home.

Usage:
    python3 server.py           # serves on port 8000
    python3 server.py 8080      # or pick another port

Add a hymn: drop a file into ./hymns/ named NNN-slug.txt
where NNN is a 3-digit number and slug is any short name.

File format:
    Title of the hymn
    [Speed:4]          <- optional, musician auto-scroll speed
    [Key:G]            <- optional, original key (shown when transposing)
    <blank line>
    <optional short label alone on its own line, e.g. "1" or "C">
    Verse line 1
    Verse line 2
    <blank line separates blocks>
    <another optional label>
    More lines
    ...

Labels: any short string (up to 6 chars, no spaces) on its own line
at the start of a block. Examples: 1, 2, 3, C (chorus), B (bridge),
Cd (coda), †. The order of blocks in the file is the order shown.
Repeat a chorus by copy-pasting the C block between verses.

Song settings (optional, musician view only):
    [Speed:4]   Starting auto-scroll speed. Any number, decimals OK
                (e.g. 3.5). Songs without it start at DEFAULT_SPEED.
                The musician can nudge it with − / + on the page; when
                she does, the page shows "WAS 4" so she can tell you
                the new number to bake in.
    [Key:G]     The key the chords are written in (G, Bb, F#m, Em...).
                Only used to label the key while transposing. If it's
                missing, the first chord in the song is used as a guess.
Each goes on its own line, anywhere after the title. They never show
on either view. Capitalization and spaces don't matter ([speed: 4]).

Chords (optional, ChordPro-style, inline):
    Amazing [G]grace how [C]sweet the [G]sound
    That [G]saved a [Em]wretch like [D]me

Put a chord in square brackets right before the syllable it plays
on. Any characters except a closing bracket work inside (G, G7, Am,
F#m, Csus4, G/B, N.C., etc.).

On the PUBLIC hymnal (/hymn/N/), [X] markers are stripped out — the
congregation only sees the lyrics. On the MUSICIAN mirror
(/musician/hymn/N/), [X] markers render inline as pink brackets right
where they appear in the text, so the musician sees where each chord
change lands. You can convert songs to chorded format one at a time;
songs without markers just render as lyrics on both views.

Musician controls (bottom bar on /musician/hymn/N/):
    PLAY / PAUSE    8-second countdown, then auto-scroll. Pause any time.
    RESET           Stops, jumps to the top, restores the file's speed.
    SPEED − / +     Slower / faster, before or during scrolling.
    KEY − / + / ↺   Transpose chords down / up a half step; ↺ = original.
                    (Hidden on songs with no chords.)
    SIZE − / + / ↺  Text size; ↺ = default. Remembered between songs.
    ☀ / ☾           Normal look / dark mode. Remembered between songs.
The screen is kept awake while counting down and scrolling (needs the
https Tailscale Funnel URL; most phones/tablets from 2023 on support it).

Musician notes (optional, musician view only):
    Notes
    Capo 3 for original key
    Slower on verse 3

Add a block labeled "Notes" (or "Notes:") at the end of the hymn file.
Anything in that block renders as a small musician-only footer on
/musician/hymn/N/ — capo positions, key change reminders, tempo cues.
The public view skips it entirely.
